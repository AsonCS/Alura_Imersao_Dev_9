# Alura Imersão Dev 9

### I am participating on an event from Alura, where I have to implement some mini games.

1. [Wons Converter](https://asoncs.github.io/Alura_Imersao_Dev_9/wons-converter/)
    - Just convert wons to brazilian Real
2. [Jo Ken Po - 🪨🧻✂️](https://asoncs.github.io/Alura_Imersao_Dev_9/JoKenPo/)
    - A simple game, where you chose between 🪨🧻✂️, but I made this funnier, by giving to the computer advantage, there is a test button that can be used with the console, to understand this 😅
3. [Glass Floor](https://asoncs.github.io/Alura_Imersao_Dev_9/glassFloor/)
    - A quiz game, just answer the weird questions 😅
