# Alura Imersão Dev 9

### I am participating on an event from Alura, where I have to implement some mini games.

1. [Wons Converter](https://asoncs.github.io/Alura_Imersao_Dev_9/WonsConverter/)
    - Just convert wons to brazilian Real
2. [Jo Ken Po - 🪨🧻✂️](https://asoncs.github.io/Alura_Imersao_Dev_9/JoKenPo/)
    - A simple game, where you chose between 🪨🧻✂️, but I made this funnier, by giving to the computer advantage, there is a test button that can be used with the console, to understand this 😅
3. [Glass Floor](https://asoncs.github.io/Alura_Imersao_Dev_9/GlassFloor/)
    - A quiz game, just answer the weird questions 😅
4. [Better of Three](https://asoncs.github.io/Alura_Imersao_Dev_9/BetterOfThree/)
    - Just chose a character and play against the computer
5. [Final Quiz](https://asoncs.github.io/Alura_Imersao_Dev_9/FinalQuiz/)
    - A multiple choice quiz to test your knowledge
